## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture

The game uses a **scene-based architecture** with multiple game states:
- **CategorySelectScene** - Choose game category
- **LevelSelectScene** - Choose level within category
- **LevelScene** - Active gameplay

### Physics System

- Gravity-based movement with collision detection
- Platform carrying (player moves with moving platforms)
- Crush detection (death when trapped between objects)
- Precise hit detection for hazards

### Save System

Progress is automatically saved to `save.json`:
```json
{
    "deaths": 41,
    "unlocked_cats": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "unlocked_lvls": {"0": [0, 1, 2], "1": [0, 1, 2]},
    "completed": {"0_0": true, "0_1": true}
}
```
